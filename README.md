<h2> What is Currency Converter? </h2>
<p> A currency converter is software code that is designed to convert one currency into another in order to check its corresponding value. The code is generally a part of a web site or it forms a mobile app and it is based on current market or bank exchange rates.
<br><br>
In order to convert one currency into another, a user enters an amount of money (e.g. '1000') and chooses the currency he/she wishes to check the monetary value of (e.g. 'United States Dollar'). After that, the user selects one, or sometimes several other currencies, he/she would like to see the result in. The application software then calculates and displays the corresponding amount of money.If you want to see an advanced currency converter,click <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/">here</a>. </p>
